This is a small library for time operations, based on [`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html).

It works with timestamps in UTC and durations, converting appropriately whenever possible. It is aware of other time objects, such as Joda Time, `java.util.Date`, string representations, and milliseconds since the Epoch, and will convert them to `java.time` objects whenever possible.

It also provides wrappers for each of the member functions around timestamps and durations, allowing for easier interoperability with the rest of the `java.time.*` packages.

The original Java time objects, such as `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar`, were minimal and proved to be inadequate, leading to the open-source [Joda Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/) library. This was the foundation of [JSR-310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310), which brought a fully capable time library into Java.

Consequently, these other libraries are deprecated, but are still in common use. QTime provides a simple way to use the new `java.time` library while still being able to work with these older libraries. QTime will convert other time formats into `java.time` objects though exporting is not handled. Exporting should typically be done by exporting milliseconds-since-the-Epoch, which can be handled by most libraries.

This library is opinionated, in that it typically works with UTC, though there is some concession to other timezones.

## Timestamps
Moments in time are described by the Java interface `java.time.Temporal`. Timestamps are handled by the `java.util.Instant` class, which implements `Temporal`, and are the main temporal object used by QTime.

Most common timestamps can be used in any function that expects a `Temporal` object, and QTime will convert it to an `Instant` whenever possible.
- `java.util.Date`
- `org.joda.time.ReadableDateTime`
- `String` - in ISO-8601 format
- `long` - milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)

## Durations
Periods of time are described by the Java interface `java.time.TemporalAmount`. These are managed in QTime by the `java.time.Duration` class.

The main other implementation of `TemporalAmount` is `java.time.Period`. This is very similar to `Duration`, but automatically handles infrequent adjustments, such as leap years. When using QTime, `Periods` are converted into `Duration`. Long values are converted into `Duration` as milliseconds.

## Conversions
Compatible types will always be converted appropriately into `Instant` or `Duration`. These include `java.util.Date` and objects from Joda Time.

Instants are all compatible with ISO-8601 strings. They can be emitted as strings in UTC, or with a timezone, using the `iso-str` function.

The `Instant` and `Duration` functions are all wrapped, with automatic conversions.
References to time units may be made with strings, keywords, or Java objects.
e.g. \"sec\" for seconds, :ms for milliseconds, java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit/NANOS for nanoseconds.

This allows function calls like:
```clojure
(until \"2025-03-22T21:53:26Z\" \"2025-12-25T00:00:00Z\" :days) ;; whole days until Christmas
(get-long (now) :day-of-year) ;; what day of the year is it?"
```

## TODO
Testing. There is so much testing to be done. The basics work though.
