# QTime
## A java.time wrapper
When released, this will be a wrapper around some `java.time` objects.

It mostly expects Instants or Durations, and will convert as necessary from strings, longs, or clj-time objects (Joda time). clj-time and Joda are not dependencies, but will be converted if present.
